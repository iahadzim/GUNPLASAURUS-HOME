Each kit has a gimmick wherein their weapons and accessories can be used with High Grade 1/144 Gunpla kits.</p></center>

First produced in 1999, the line supplanted normal HG kits such as the HG RX-78-2 Gundam. The kits are known for their ease of construction and generous use of polycaps and tinted plastic for details such as visual sensors, monoeyes and Beam Saber effect parts.
		<br>
		<br>
	Starting in 2010, the HGUC line extended to the After Colony, After War, Future Century, Cosmic Era and Correct Century timelines with the HGAC, HGAW, HGFC, HGCE, and HGCC lines, respectively, as part of the "HG All Gundam" project. Whereas the HGUC box packaging uses a gold stripe on the side panels, the alternate timeline kits are distinguished by the silver stripe on their boxes.
	    <br>
		<br>
	In June 2015, Bandai initiated the "Revive" project to celebrate the 35th anniversary of Gunpla. Starting with the RX-77-2 Guncannon, previous HG releases are given a complete redesign using newer technology with improved detail, articulation, and proportions.</p>

	<center> <p align="justify" style="font-family: 'anonymous-pro'">Real Grade (RG) (リアルグレード Riarugurēdo?) is a line of Gunpla kits by Bandai that was introduced in 2010 as part of the Gundam 30th Anniversary commemoration project. These consist of Mobile Suits from both the Universal Century and the Alternate Centuries. The RG line combines the best aspects of the other three Gunpla lines: The small size and affordable prices of the High Grade, the advanced inner frame technology of the Master Grade and the massive parts count and details of the Perfect Grade. The tagline for the RG line is "Excitement Embodied"[1]. Also, the RG line reflects what a mobile suit would look like if it were built in the present day.
	<br>
	<br>
	The RG line is known for the Advanced MS Joint, using a dual-molding technique with both ABS and PP plastics. Initially, the inner frame of RG suits were placed on a single gate for easy construction, along with hands with poseable fingers. More recently, however, the inner frames of RG kits became more dependent on hand-built inner frames made of PS or ABS plastic. Advanced MS Joint frames from here are instead are more limited and used to construct parts of the kit that are more impractical to assemble. Additionally, hands with poseable digits ceased to be included with these kits, them instead containing a wider range of fixed hands.</p>

	<p align="justify" style="font-family: 'anonymous-pro'"> Master Grade (MG) (マスターグレード Masutā Gurēdo?) is a line of 1/100 scale Gunpla kits of the Mobile Suits in the Gundam meta series. The series was first produced in 1995 as part of the Gundam 15th Anniversary project.[1]
		<br>
		<br>
	Master Grade kits differ from other 1/100 scale Gunpla, with their level of detail, articulation, and proportions being second only to the Perfect Grade line. A majority of MG kits feature a skeletal inner frame with working hydraulics, some also accommodate Gunpla LED Units for light-up gimmicks. To give viewers a perspective of the Mobile Suit's size, many MG kits come with 1/100 scale figurines of the pilots or key characters of their respective series. In addition, some kits include 1/20 scale character figures.
		<br>
		<br>
	Beginning in 2002, veteran mecha designer Hajime Katoki began redesigning various Mobile Suits and releasing them in the Master Grade line under the label of "Ver.Ka" (Version Katoki). Some of the Ver.Ka kits were produced as a result of annual fan votes. In addition, many Mobile Suits from the Universal Century and Cosmic Era timelines have received redesigns under the monikers "Ver.1.5", "Ver.2.0", "Ver.3.0", and "Ver.RM".</p>

		Perfect Grade (PG) (パーフェクトグレード Pāfekuto Gurēdo?) is a series of 1/60 scale Gunpla kits created by Bandai. The pioneer in GUNPLA engineering featuring the near perfect scaled down model from the famous anime franchise itself.
		<br>
		<br>
		The PG line originated with the release of the Perfect Grade Evangelion EVA-01 in 1997. The line was later transferred to the Gundam franchise in 1998 and was exclusive to Gundam until 2017, when Bandai announced the Perfect Grade 1/72 scale Millennium Falcon for the Star Wars franchise. 
		<br>
		<br>
		The PG line has significant external and internal details plus light up gimmicks with LEDs. The PGs are some of the most expensive Gunpla produced and have often been used to develop Master Grade and Real Grade technology.</p>
